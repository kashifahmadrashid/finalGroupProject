We have created a Task Planner. A Task Planner is basically a more advanced version of a calendar, whereby the user can allocate tasks to themselves or others. Our Task Planner has features such as ‘Review, ‘Status’, ‘Done’, ‘In Progress’ and ‘To Do’, that allow us to better track the progress of tasks, improving our efficiency, organisation and time management.
This Task Planner can be used for personal and work tasks. This Task Planner works on the user’s computer or smart phone device, making it very handy and convenient, as it is usable on the go. We also believe it is user friendly and easy to use.

Extra Features added
1. The Task filter for each category to keep track of the tasks
2. Some addition css design for illustration purpose
3. The task planner shows task cards appear on screen
